No global constants.\r\n- Using known design patterns.\r\n- Namespace\r\n- Easy to get started\r\n- Routes and reverse routing.\r\n\r\n###### Why REKS\r\n\r\nIt exists dozens of web application frameworks for PHP already, why did we create REKS framework and why should you use it for future projects?\r\n\r\nREKS is a extremely modular built framework, especially the module system. Think about if you where about to create a blog system, a blog system might have these components (modular components):\r\n\r\n- User authentication system\r\n- Content system for the blog\r\n- Commenting system\r\n\r\nAll these 3 systems can be split in to 3 modules. You might think that this is hard to split up and that takes time,\r\nbut in REKS its not worse then copying the applicable routes, configs, controllers, views and models + libraries etc into a new application\r\nfolder and include the module in the configuration of the parent application.\r\n","google":""}
